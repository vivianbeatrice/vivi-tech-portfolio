        <h4>IBM Full Stack Software Developer Capstone</h4>
        <p>
          I completed the IBM Full Stack Software Developer certification course
          to increase my expertise, gaining competency in React, TypeScript,
          JavaScript, Python, HTML, SQL, Git, GitHub, CSS, Cloud Computing,
          Node.js, Express.js, Data Science, AI, Flask, Bootstrap, Django,
          Databases, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.
        </p>
        <h4>RE Scanner</h4>
        <p>
          During my time as an Operations Manager, my team was flooded with an
          influx of rote work and no additional resources to make the increase
          in tasks manegable. Using Python, I coded the proof of concept for an
          internal tool that connected two APIs in order to automate and label
          work for swifter completion. Using Agile and Scrum, I was able to
          Project Management the completion of the RE Scanner to delivery ahead
          of deadline, which went on to save our team $50k worth of labor within
          the first 90 days of implementation.

        </h4>
        <p>
          I began my software development journey by building my own web games
          using GML, a JavaScript and C-like language, which instilled in me a
          love for coding.
